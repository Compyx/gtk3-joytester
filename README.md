# gtk3-joytester

Gtk3 joystick code testing for VICE, or rather Linux joystick code testing which may someday land in VICE.

Currently this code is completely unusable. Widgets are unfinished/missing, the joystick polling is backwards and the Meson/Ninja stuff is missing any checks for non-gtk3 headers.
It also needs a lot more CFLAGS to adhere to my 'standard'.
